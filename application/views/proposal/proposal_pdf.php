		   	THIS AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) is made as of the <?php echo date('M d, Y') ?> (the “Effective Date”), by and between Anbruch Inc. (“Anbruch”), with offices at 25 The Esplanade PO Box 122 Station A Toronto ON M5W 1A2 and <?php echo $proposal_company ?> with offices at <?php echo $proposal_address ?> (“Client”). Anbruch and Client may be referred to herein independently as a “Party” and/or collectively as the “Parties.”
			
			</div>
			<div  class="mt-2">
			WHEREAS Anbruch is in the business of saving clients money by reducing category specific expenditures and identifying unclaimed assets, refunds, prebates, rebates, credits and/or other forms of monetary benefit due them; and,
			
			</div>
			<div class="mt-2">
			WHEREAS, Anbruch offers many expense categories available for evaluation. Those that qualify and are mutually agreed to are “Engaged Categories” at the end of the consulting agreement in APPENDIX A: ENGAGED CATEGORIES; and,
  			
  			</div>
  			<div class="mt-2">
			WHEREAS, Anbruch evaluates Client’s invoices, bills, statements, etc. (collectively “Client Information”) in Engaged Categories to provide assessments, recommendations, strategies, protocols, procedures and/or initiatives (collectively, Anbruch work product, hereinafter known as “Deliverables”) which, if implemented, should reduce said expenditures; and,
			
			</div>
			<div class="mt-2">
			WHEREAS, Client wishes to engage Anbruch to implement Deliverables for those Engaged Categories; 
			
			</div>
			<div class="mt-2">
			NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the Parties agree as follows:
		   
		   </div>
		   <div class="ol-data">
			   	<ol class="ol-list">
				  <li><strong>Client Realized Benefits (“Realized Benefits”):</strong>
				  		<ol type="a">
				  			<li>Client Realized Benefits are based on the Engaged Category in APPENDIX A and by Independent Location which are any and all cost savings, prebates, rebates, recoveries, credits, refunds, discounts, cash, interest and/or any other form of monetary benefit received by Client, independently or aggregately, as a result of Anbruch Deliverables, its agents, employees, relationships or actions, and are recorded as either:
				  			 <ol type="i">
				  			 	<li>
				  			 		“Cost Savings”: the delta between a “Benchmark” (the current spend for each Engaged Category derived from the Client Information) which will be a separate “Benchmark Document” signed by the client after execution of this agreement, and the updated spend on a forward looking basis once Anbruch Deliverables have been implemented;
				  			 	</li>
				  			 	<li>
				  			 		“Benchmark Document”: this will be a separately agreed upon document that supplements this agreement, capturing the Clients current spend per itemized cost and agreed upon by the Client to be used to calculate the savings on a go forward basis each month and for the term of this agreement; 
				  			 	</li>
				  			 	<li>“Credits/Refunds”: any and all cash, refunds, prebates, rebates, recoveries, discounts, interest, credits, penalties credited, and/or any other type of monetary benefit identified and/or recovered, or received by Client by way of cheque or credit from suppliers, by cheque from a government tax authority or by reduction of accrued taxes or by credit as a result of Anbruch Deliverables;
				  			 	</li>
				  			 	<li>
				  			 		“Independent Location”: any location that has a different legal address than another location operated by the client and that is considered under the scope of an Engaged Category. 
				  			 	</li>
				  			 </ol>	
				  			</li>
				  			<li>
				  				The date Client first receives a Realized Benefit(s) (defined above in Section 1a) in any Engaged Category in the <strong>Savings</strong> field and by Independent Location, is when the Realized Benefits Commencement Date will start the payment term identified in Section 2 below. Each Engaged Category and Independent Location may have a different Commencement date, and the term identified below will begin from each of the specific Engaged Category and Independent Location Commencement Dates.  For clarity, should Client receive an initial Realized Benefit in Category "A" by Independent Location in month 3 of the contract, the payment term will begin in month 3 (the Realized Benefits Commencement Date), not the execution date.  In the instant matter with a 24 month term, Anbruch will receive its payment for Category “A" by Independent Location starting in month 3, continuing through and including month 27 despite a 24 month term from execution date.  If Client receives a Realized Benefit in Category “B” by Independent Location in month 10, Anbruch will receive its payment for Category “B” by Independent Location starting in month 10 and continuing through and including month 34. This only is in effect for any Engaged Category in the Savings field.
				  			</li>
				  			<li>
				  				The date Client first receives a Realized Benefit(s) (defined above in Section 1a) in any Engaged Category in the <strong>Credits/Refunds</strong> field and by Independent Location, is when the Realized Benefits Commencement Date will start the payment term identified in Section 2 below. 
				  			</li>
				  		</ol>
				  </li>
				  <li class="mt-3"><strong>CONSULTING FEES: Savings and/or Credits/Refunds.</strong>
				  		Anbruch Fees are based on either: a percentage (below) of future savings created by lowering a current cost (“benchmark”), the “Savings”; or, as a percentage of a refund, the “Credits/Refunds”. Credits/Refunds offer a one-time payment whereas savings are ongoing in accordance with the term below.	
				  		<ol type="a">
				  			<li><strong>Savings:</strong>
				  				Client agrees to pay Anbruch THIRTY percent (30%) for THIRTY-SIX (36)  months of any Realized Benefit(s) derived as a result of Cost Savings in any Engaged Category;
				  				<ol type="i">
				  					<li>Said fees will be invoiced 30 days following the Realized Benefits Commencement Date and continue throughout the agreed-upon term;</li>
				  				</ol>
				  			</li>
				  			<li><strong>Credits/Refunds:</strong>Client agrees to pay Anbruch THIRTY  percent (30%) of any Realized Benefit(s) identified and derived from any Credits in any Engaged Category;
				  				<ol type="i">
				  					<li>
				  						Said fees will be invoiced on the Realized Benefit(s) Commencement Date;
				  					</li>
				  				</ol>
				  			</li>
				  			<li>
				  				Fees above will commence at the time of the initial realized benefit(s) for each category/property.
				  			</li>
				  		</ol>
				  </li>

				  <li class="mt-3"><strong>Non-Circumvent:</strong>
				  	By entering into this Agreement, Client will refrain from implementing cost savings strategies in any Engaged Category without Anbruch. Notwithstanding the foregoing:
				  	<ol type="a">
				  		<li>To the extent Client has implemented any cost savings strategies and/or commenced any proceedings related to any Engaged Category(s), Client will disclose same prior to execution of this Agreement.</li>
				  		<li>
				  			Client is not under any obligation to implement any Deliverables and shall have the right to reject anything proposed by Anbruch, in Client’s sole and absolute discretion, without liability to Anbruch hereunder;
				  		</li>
				  		<li>
				  			Should Client implement any strategy related to an Engaged Category(s) without Anbruch, subsequent to Anbruch presenting its Deliverables, Anbruch will be entitled to receive its Consulting Fees pursuant to section 2 above as though it had implemented and presented same;
				  		</li>
				  	</ol>
				  </li>
				  <li class="mt-3"><strong>Audit Rights:</strong>
				  	Anbruch will have access as needed to Client’s information (statements, bills, invoices etc.) in order to benchmark, determine historical versus present expenditures, continual monitoring of pricing awareness and vendor compliance in any Engaged Category. This audit right shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of two (2) years.
				  </li>
				  <li class="mt-3"><strong>Access to Information:</strong>
				  	Upon execution of this Agreement, Anbruch will send a data request for each Engaged Category. The data request may include accounting and financial records, documents, invoices, spend data, existing related contracts/ proposals, and/or other collateral necessary for Anbruch to generate Deliverables. Client will provide Anbruch same within 30 days of request.
				  </li>
				  <li class="mt-3"><strong>Independent Contractor:</strong>
				  	It is understood and agreed that this Agreement does not create any relationship of association, partnership or joint venture between the parties, nor constitute either party as the agent or legal representative of the other for any purpose whatsoever; and the relationship of Consultant to the Company for all purposes shall be one of independent contractor. Neither party shall have any right or authority to create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf or in the name of the other, or to bind the other in any manner whatsoever.
				  </li>
				  <li class="mt-3"><strong>Indemnification:</strong>
				  	<ol type="a">
				  		<li>Anbruch shall not be liable to the Client or any supplier, including but not limited to any government authorities, for omissions, errors or inaccuracies originating from the Client’s records or documents, and the Client will hold Anbruch and its agents harmless from and against, any and all, claims, losses, damages, liabilities, penalties, punitive damages, expenses, reasonable legal fees and costs of any kind or amount whatsoever where these directly relate to omissions, errors or inaccuracies in the Client’s records.
				  		</li>
				  		<li>
				  			Anbruch shall indemnify, release, and hold Client, its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, past, present and future, harmless from and against any liability, damages, losses, costs, judgments, fines, penalties or expenses, including legal expenses, arising out of claims, demands, actions, causes of action, proceedings or suits, whether in law or inequity, due to, arising out of, incidental to or in connection with: (1) any acts or omissions or Anbruch, its employees or agents; (2) any breach of the terms of this agreement by Anbruch; and (3) any negligence by Anbruch, its employees or agents.
				  		</li>
				  		<li>

				  </li>
				  <li class="mt-3"><strong>Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure: </strong>
				  	<ol type="a">
				  		<li>
				  			In connection with this Agreement each Party may receive or have access to confidential information concerning the other Party, including, without limitation, financial information and trade secrets and Methods, which is non-public and may be proprietary in nature, and may include personal information about the Client’s customers and employees.

				  		</li>
				  		<li>
				  			Anbruch shall maintain industry-accepted standards, tools and processes to ensure the Client’s confidential information is encrypted and protected from release at all times. Unless it is expressly required by law to retain certain records, Anbruch agrees to delete any confidential information belonging to the Client upon written request by the Client. If any of the Client’s confidential information is released or otherwise is believed by Anbruch to have been viewed by an unauthorized third-party, Anbruch shall immediately notify the Client and support the Client’s efforts in ensuring containment of this breach and ensuring any exposure to the Client is mitigated. The Client and Anbruch agree to keep confidential all the terms of this agreement.
				  		</li>
				  		<li>
